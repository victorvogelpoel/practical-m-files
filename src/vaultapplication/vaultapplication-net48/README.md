# M-Files sample vault application vaultapplication-net48

This sample Vault Application has target .NET Framework 4.8, instead of the default 4.5, and demonstrates that it can run in the vault.
.NET framework 4.5 is no longer supported by Microsoft and 4.8 opens the vault application to use more recent code packages.
